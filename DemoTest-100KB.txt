Juventus Football Club (from Latin: iuventūs, 'youth'; Italian pronunciation: [juˈvɛntus]), commonly known as Juventus or colloquially as Juve (pronounced [ˈjuːve]),[5] is an Italian professional football club based in Turin, Piedmont, who compete in Serie A, the top tier of the Italian football league system. Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club played in different grounds around the city, and plays now in Juventus Stadium.

Nicknamed la Vecchia Signora ("the Old Lady"), it has won 36 official league titles, 15 Coppa Italia trophies and nine Italian Super Cups, being the record holder for all these competitions; they also hold two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cup / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, three UEFA Cups (Italian record), two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup (Italian record).[6][7] Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification,[c] whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies,[9] as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking,[d] having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited.

Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club,[11] it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006–07 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923.[e] The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus one of the first professional sporting clubs ante litteram in the country,[13] having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s,[14] and becoming, in a nearly stable basis, one of the top-ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s,[15] being listed on the Borsa Italiana since 2001.[16]

Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international tournaments, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976–77 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983–84 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984–85 European Champions' Cup.[17] With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all five historical confederation trophies;[18] an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi,[19] becoming in addition, until 2022, the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association.[f] In December 2000, Juventus was placed seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world,[20] and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.[21]

The club's fan base is the largest at the national level and one of the largest worldwide.[22][23] Unlike most European sporting supporters' groups, which are often concentrated around their own club's city of origin,[24] it is widespread throughout the whole country and the Italian diaspora, making Juventus a symbol of anticampanilismo ("anti-parochialism") and italianità ("Italianness").[25][26] Juventus players have won eight Ballon d'Or awards, four of these in consecutive years (1982–1985, an overall joint record), among these Michel Platini as well as three of the five recipients with Italian nationality as the first player representing Serie A, Omar Sívori, and the former member of the youth sector Paolo Rossi; they have also won four FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners as Roberto Baggio and Zinedine Zidane, a national record and third and joint second highest overall, respectively, in the cited prizes. Finally, the club has also provided the most players to the Italy national team—mostly in official competitions in almost uninterrupted way since 1924—who often formed the group that led the Azzurri squad to international success, most importantly in the 1934, 1982 and 2006 FIFA World Cups.[27][28]
History
Main article: History of Juventus F.C.
Early years (1897–1918)
One of the first Juventus club shot, 1899

Juventus was founded as Sport-Club Juventus in late 1897 by pupils from the Massimo d'Azeglio Lyceum school in Turin, among them Eugenio Canfari and Enrico Canfari.[29] It was renamed as Foot-Ball Club Juventus two years later.[30] The club joined the 1900 Italian Football Championship. Juventus played their first Italian Football Championship match on 11 March 1900 in a 1–0 defeat against Torinese.[31]
The Juventus team during the 1905 season in which they won their first league title

In 1904, businessman Marco Ajmone-Marsan revived the finances of Juventus, making it possible to transfer the training field from piazza d'armi to the more appropriate Velodrome Umberto I. During this period, the team wore a pink and black kit. Juventus first won the 1905 Italian Football Championship while playing at their Velodrome Umberto I ground. By this time, the club colours had changed to black and white stripes, inspired by English side Notts County.[32]

There was a split at the club in 1906, after some of the staff considered moving Juve out of Turin.[30] Alfred Dick, the club's president,[g] was unhappy with this, and left with some prominent players to found FBC Torino, which in turn spawned the Derby della Mole.[33] Juventus spent much of this period steadily rebuilding after the split, surviving the First World War.[32]

In 1913, Juventus was relegated to the second division after ended in last place, but after pressure made by their executives to the Italian Federation, it was decided to increase the number of teams in the following season, that permitted Juventus to remain in the top league.[34][35]
League dominance (1923–1980)

In 1922, a new stadium was inaugurated and, a year later, FIAT vice president Edoardo Agnelli was elected club's president.[30] These two events helped the club to its second league championship in the 1925–26 Prima Divisione, after beating Alba Roma in a two-legged final with an aggregate score of 12–1.[32] The club established itself as a major force in Italian football in the 1930s, becoming the country's first professional club and the first with a decentralised fan base.[36] This led Juventus to win a record of five consecutive Italian football championships and form the core of the Italy national football team during the Vittorio Pozzo era, including the 1934 FIFA World Cup winning squad, with star players like Raimundo Orsi, Luigi Bertolini, Giovanni Ferrari, and Luis Monti, among others.[37][38]

Juventus moved to the Stadio Comunale, but for the rest of the 1930s and the majority of the 1940s they were unable to recapture championship dominance. After the Second World War, Gianni Agnelli was appointed president.[30] In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the club added two more league championships to its name, winning the 1949–50 Serie A under the management of Englishman Jesse Carver, and then repeating in the 1951–52 Serie A. For the 1957–58 Serie A, two new strikers, Welshman John Charles and Italian Argentine Omar Sívori, were signed to play alongside longtime member Giampiero Boniperti. In the 1959–60 Juventus F.C. season, they beat Fiorentina to complete their first league and cup double, winning the 1959–60 Serie A and the 1960 Coppa Italia final. Boniperti retired in 1961 as the all-time top scorer at the club, with 182 goals in all competitions, a club record that stood for 45 years.[39]

During the rest of the decade, the club only won the 1966–67 Serie A.[32] The 1970s saw Juventus further solidify their strong position in Italian football, and under former player Čestmír Vycpálek they won the scudetto in the 1971–72 Serie A, and followed through in the 1972–73 Serie A,[32] with players like as Roberto Bettega, Franco Causio, and José Altafini breaking through. During the rest of the decade, they won the league thrice more, with defender Gaetano Scirea contributing significantly. The latter two success in Serie A was under Giovanni Trapattoni, who also led the club to their first ever major European title, the 1976–77 UEFA Cup, and helped the club's domination continue on into the early part of the 1980s.[40]

The club led under Trapattoni in the 1980s brought them the league title three more times by 1984.[32] This meant Juventus had won 20 Italian league titles and were allowed to add a second golden star to their shirt, becoming the only Italian club to achieve this.[40] Around this time, the club's players were attracting considerable attention, and Paolo Rossi was named European Footballer of the Year following his contribution to Italy's victory in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where he was named Player of the Tournament.[41]

Frenchman Michel Platini was awarded the European Footballer of the Year title for three years in a row in 1983, 1984 and 1985, which is a record.[42] Juventus are the first and one of the only two clubs to have players from their club winning the award in four consecutive years.[43][h] It was Platini who scored the winning goal in the 1985 European Cup final against Liverpool; this was marred by the Heysel Stadium disaster, which changed European football.[45] That year, Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three major UEFA competitions;[46][47] after their triumph in the 1985 Intercontinental Cup, the club also became the first and thus far the only in association football history to have won all five possible confederation competitions,[48] an achievement that it revalidated with a sixth title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup.[49][50]

With the exception of winning the closely contested 1985–86 Serie A, the rest of the 1980s were not very successful for the club. As well as having to contend with Diego Maradona's Napoli, both of the Milanese clubs, A.C. Milan and Inter Milan, won Italian championships; Juventus achieved a double by winning the 1989–90 Coppa Italia and the 1990 UEFA Cup final under the guidance of former club legend Dino Zoff.[32] In 1990, Juventus also moved into their new home, the Stadio delle Alpi, which was built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup.[51] Despite the arrival of Italian star Roberto Baggio later that year for a world football transfer record fee, the early 1990s under Luigi Maifredi and subsequently Trapattoni once again also saw little success for Juventus, as they only managed to win the 1993 UEFA Cup final.[52]

Marcello Lippi took over as Juventus manager at the start of the 1994–95 Serie A.[30] His first season at the helm of the club was a successful one, as Juventus recorded their first Serie A championship title since the mid-1980s, as well as the 1995 Coppa Italia final.[32] The crop of players during this period featured Ciro Ferrara, Roberto Baggio, Gianluca Vialli, and a young Alessandro Del Piero. Lippi led Juventus to the 1995 Supercoppa Italiana and the 1995–96 UEFA Champions League, beating Ajax on penalties after a 1–1 draw in which Fabrizio Ravanelli scored for Juventus.[53]

The club did not rest long after winning the European Cup, as more highly regarded players were brought into the fold in the form of Zinedine Zidane, Filippo Inzaghi, and Edgar Davids. At home, Juventus won the 1996–97 Serie A, successfully defended their title in the 1997–98 Serie A, won the 1996 UEFA Super Cup,[54] and followed through with the 1996 Intercontinental Cup.[55] Juventus reached two consecutive Champions League finals during this period but lost out to Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid,[56][57] respectively in 1997 and 1998.[58][59]

After a two-and-a-half-season absence, Lippi returned to the club in 2001, following his replacement Carlo Ancelotti's dismissal, signing big name players like Gianluigi Buffon, David Trezeguet, Pavel Nedvěd, and Lilian Thuram, helping the team to win the 2001–02 Serie A, which was their first since 1998, and confirmed themselves in the 2002–03 Serie A.[32] Juventus were also part of the all Italian 2003 UEFA Champions League final but lost out to Milan on penalties after the game ended in a 0–0 draw. At the conclusion of the following season, Lippi was appointed as the Italy national team's head coach, bringing an end to one of the most fruitful managerial spells in Juventus's history.[40]
Calciopoli scandal (2004–2007)

Fabio Capello was appointed as Juventus's coach in 2004 and led the club to two more consecutive Serie A first places. In May 2006, Juventus emerged as one of the five clubs linked to the Calciopoli scandal. In July, Juventus was placed at the bottom of the league table and relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history. The club was also stripped of the 2004–05 Serie A title, while the 2005–06 Serie A winner, after a period sub judice, was declared to be third-placed Inter Milan.[60] This remains a much debated and controversial issue,[61][62][63] particularly due to Inter Milan's later revealed involvement, the 2004 championship (the sole being investigated) deemed regular and not fixed,[64][65][66] Juventus being absolved as club in the ordinary justice proceedings,[67][68] their renounce to the Italian civil courts appeal, which could have cleared the club's name and avoid relegation, after FIFA threatened to suspend the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) and barring all Italian clubs from international play,[69][70][71] and the motivations,[72] such as sentimento popolare (people's feelings),[73] and the newly created ad-hoc rule used to relegate the club.[74][75][76]
Star goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon was among a group of players who remained with the club following their demotion to Serie B in 2006.

Many key players left following their relegation to Serie B, including Thuram, star striker Zlatan Ibrahimović, midfielders Emerson and Patrick Vieira, and defensive stalwarts Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluca Zambrotta;[77] other big name players, such as Del Piero, Buffon, Trezeguet, and Nedvěd, as well as the club's future defense core Giorgio Chiellini, remained to help the club return to Serie A,[78] while youngsters from the Campionato Nazionale Primavera (youth team), such as Sebastian Giovinco and Claudio Marchisio, were integrated into the first team.[79][80] Juventus won the Cadetti title (Serie B championship) despite starting with a points deduction and gained promotion straight back up to the top division, with Del Piero claiming the top scorer award with 21 goals, as league winners after the 2006–07 Serie B season.[81]

As early as 2010, when many other clubs were implicated and Inter Milan, Livorno, and Milan liable of direct Article 6 violations in the 2011 Palazzi Report, Juventus considered challenging the stripping of their scudetto from 2005 and the non-assignment of the 2006 title, dependent on the results of Calciopoli trials connected to the 2006 scandal.[82] When former general manager Luciano Moggi's conviction in criminal court in connection with the scandal was partially written off by the Supreme Court in March 2015,[83][84] the club sued the FIGC for €443 million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation. Then-FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio offered to discuss reinstatement of the lost scudetti in exchange for Juventus dropping the lawsuit.[85]

In September 2015, the Supreme Court released a 150-page document that explained its final ruling of the case, based on the controversial 2006 sports ruling, which did not take in consideration the other clubs involved because they could not be put on trial due to the statute of limitations, and it would be necessary to request and open a revocation of judgment pursuant to Article 39 of the Code of Sports Justice. Despite his remaining charges being cancelled without a new trial due to statute of limitations, the court confirmed that Moggi was actively involved in the sporting fraud, which was intended to favour Juventus and increase his own personal benefits according to La Gazzetta dello Sport.[86] As did the Naples court in 2012,[87][88] the court commented that the developments and behavior of other clubs and executives were not investigated in depth.[89] Once they exhausted their appeals in Italy's courts,[90] both Moggi and Giraudo appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in March 2020; Giraudo's was accepted in September 2021.[91][92] Juventus continued to present new appeals,[93] which were declared inadmissible.[94]
Return to Serie A (2007–2011)

After making their comeback for the 2007–08 Serie A, Juventus appointed Claudio Ranieri as manager.[95] They finished in third place in their first season back in the top flight and qualified for the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League's third qualifying round in the preliminary stages. Juventus reached the group stages, where they beat Real Madrid in both home and away legs, before losing in the knockout round to Chelsea. Ranieri was sacked following a string of unsuccessful results and Ciro Ferrara was appointed as manager on a temporary basis for the last two games of the 2008–09 Serie A,[96] before being subsequently appointed as the manager for the 2009–10 Serie A.[97]

Ferrara's stint as Juventus manager proved to be unsuccessful, with Juventus knocked out of 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, and also of the 2009–10 Coppa Italia, as well as just lying on the sixth place in the league table at the end of January 2010, leading to the dismissal of Ferrara and the naming of Alberto Zaccheroni as caretaker manager. Zaccheroni could not help the side improve, as Juventus finished the season in seventh place in Serie A. For the 2010–11 Serie A, Jean-Claude Blanc was replaced by Andrea Agnelli as the club's president. Agnelli's first action was to replace Zaccheroni and director of sport Alessio Secco with Sampdoria manager Luigi Delneri and director of sport Giuseppe Marotta.[98] Delneri failed to improve their fortunes and was dismissed, and former player and fan favourite Antonio Conte, fresh after winning promotion with Siena, was named as Delneri's replacement.[99] In September 2011, Juventus relocated to the new Juventus Stadium, known as the Allianz Stadium since 2017.[100]
Nine consecutive scudetti (2011–2020)

With Conte as manager, Juventus were unbeaten for the entire 2011–12 Serie A season. Towards the second half of the season, the team was mostly competing with northern rivals Milan for first place in a tight contest. Juventus won the title on the 37th matchday after beating Cagliari 2–0 and Milan losing to Inter 4–2. After a 3–1 win in the final matchday against Atalanta, Juventus became the first team to go the season unbeaten in the current 38-game format.[101] In 2013–14 Serie A, Juventus won a third consecutive scudetto with a record 102 points and 33 wins.[102][103] The title was the 30th official league championship in the club's history.[104] They also achieved the semi-finals of 2013–14 UEFA Europa League, where they were eliminated at home against ten-man Benfica's catenaccio, missing the 2014 UEFA Europa League final at the Juventus Stadium.[105][106]

In the 2014–15 Serie A, Massimiliano Allegri was appointed as manager, with whom Juventus won their 31st official title, making it a fourth-straight, as well as achieving a record tenth Coppa Italia, after beating Lazio 2–2 in the 2015 Coppa Italia final, for the domestic double.[107] The club also beat Real Madrid 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals of the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League to face Barcelona in the 2015 UEFA Champions League final in Berlin for the first time since the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League.[108] Juventus lost the final against Barcelona 3–1.[109] In the 2016 Coppa Italia final, the club won the title for the 11th time and second straight win, becoming the first team in Italy's history to win Serie A and Coppa Italia doubles in back-to-back seasons.[110][111][112] In the 2017 Coppa Italia final, Juventus won their 12th Coppa Italia title in a 2–0 win over Lazio, becoming the first team to win three consecutive titles.[113] Four days later on 21 May, Juventus became the first team to win six consecutive Serie A titles.[114] In the 2017 UEFA Champions League final, their second Champions League final in three years, Juventus were defeated 1–4 by defending champions Real Madrid; the 2017 Turin stampede happened ten minutes before the end of the match.[115][116] In the 2018 Coppa Italia final, Juventus won their 13th title and fourth in a row in a 4–0 win over Milan, extending the all-time record of successive Coppa Italia titles.[117] Juventus then secured their seventh consecutive Serie A title, extending the all-time record of successive triumphs in the competition.[118]
Juventus's signing of Cristiano Ronaldo in 2018 elevated the club's popularity

Juventus, eager to secure the Champions League title, signed Cristiano Ronaldo for £99.2 million from Real Madrid on 10 July 2018.[119] In Italy, the signing was dubbed the "deal of the century."[119] For Juventus, the signing of Ronaldo went beyond football—it represented a step toward elevating the club's status as a global business. Deloitte ranked the world's richest clubs earlier in the year and Juventus ranked 10th; by leveraging Ronaldo's massive social media following and commercial appeal, the club expected to close the financial gap with the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Manchester United.[119] In the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, which was held in January 2019, Juventus and Milan, who were tied for Supercoppa Italiana wins with seven each, played against each other; Juventus won their eight title after beating Milan 1–0.[120] In April 2019, Juventus secured their eighth consecutive Serie A title, further extending the all-time record of successive triumphs in the competition.[121] Following Allegri's departure,[122] Maurizio Sarri was appointed manager of the club ahead of the 2019–20 Juventus F.C. season.[123] Juventus were confirmed 2019–20 Serie A champions, reaching an unprecedented milestone of nine consecutive league titles.[124] Ronaldo was key to Juventus's continuation of domestic success; notable achievements include his reaching 100 goals in Serie A quicker than anyone in the league's history.[125] He also equalled the record of scoring in the most consecutive Serie A matches (11).[125]
Recent history (2020–present)

On 8 August 2020, Sarri was sacked from his managerial position, one day after Juventus were eliminated from the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League by Lyon.[126] On the same day, former player Andrea Pirlo was announced as the new coach, signing a two-year contract.[127] In the 2020 Supercoppa Italiana, which was held in January 2021, Juventus won their ninth title after a 2–0 victory against Napoli.[128] With Inter Milan's win of the 2020–21 Serie A, Juventus's run of nine consecutive titles came to an end;[129] the club managed to secure a fourth-place finish on the final day of the league, granting Juventus qualification to the following season's Champions League.[130] In the 2021 Coppa Italia final, Juventus won their 14th title.[131] On 28 May, Juventus sacked Pirlo from his managerial position,[132][133] and announced Allegri's return to the club as manager after two years away from management on a four-year contract.[134] During the three seasons that featured Ronaldo, the Champions League all-time top scorer, Juventus disappointingly failed to win the Champions League.[125] Ronaldo left the club for Manchester United in late 2021.[125]

Although Allegri had considered the victory of the scudetto as a seasonal goal,[135] Juventus reached another fourth place in the league.[136] After losing 4–2 after extra time to Inter Milan in the 2022 Coppa Italia final, the 2021–22 Juventus F.C. season marked the first season since 2010–11 in which the club had not won a trophy.[136] In the 2022–23 season, Juventus had one victory and five defeats in their Champions League group, achieving their worst-ever score (3 points) and their greatest-ever number of losses in the competition's group stage.[137] Through their better goal difference over fourth-placed Maccabi Haifa, the team finished third and dropped down into the Europa League,[137] in which they were defeated 2–1 by Sevilla after extra time at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium in the semi-final.[138] On 28 November 2022, the entire board of directors resigned from their respective positions, Andrea Agnelli as president, Pavel Nedvěd as vice president, and Maurizio Arrivabene as CEO.[139][140][141] Agnelli's presidency was the most victorious of the club's history, with 19 titles won.[142] Exor, the club's controlling shareholder, appointed Gianluca Ferrero as its new chairman ahead of the shareholders' meeting on 18 January 2023.[143]

Two days later, after being acquitted by the FIGC's Court of Appeal in April–May 2022,[144][145][146] Juventus were deducted 15 points as punishment for capital gain violations,[147] as part of an investigation related to the 2019–2021 budgets during the COVID-19 pandemic starting in November 2021.[148] This was harsher than the point deduction recommended by the FIGC prosecutor, who said that in the standings Juventus "must now finish behind Roma, outside the European Cup area".[149][150] The penalty caused an uproar and protests among Juventus supporters,[151] who cancelled, or threatened to do so, their Sky Sport and DAZN subscriptions.[152][153][154] Following Juventus's appeal, the decision had initially been reversed on 20 April 2023,[155] but the club were given a new penalty, this time of ten points, on 22 May.[156] Within the aforementioned FIGC's inquiry, on 29 May, Juventus proposed a plea bargain for their false accounting on staff salaries;[157][158] the request was accepted one day later and Juventus only received a fine of €718,240 without any further penalty.[159] Juventus finished the 2022–23 Serie A in seventh place and qualified to the UEFA Europa Conference League with 62 points.[i][160] However, on 28 July, UEFA ejected Juventus from its competitions for one year as the club violated a settlement agreement with UEFA signed in August 2022.[161] The 2023–24 season was the first in which Juventus did not participate in UEFA competitions since 2011–12.[161]

Due to their UEFA competition ban, Juventus only had the Serie A title and Coppa Italia to play for during the 2023–24 season. In Serie A Juventus finished the season in third place with 71 points, qualifying for the champions league but they finished the season 23 points behind a dominant Inter Milan side. In the Coppa Italia, Juventus made the final where they would face Atalanta. Juventus would win the final 1–0 after an early goal from Dušan Vlahović, earning the Turin club their 15th Coppa Italia title.[162] However the game was not without controversy, as manager Massimiliano Allegri was sent off in stoppage time after shouting at the 4th official. Allegri after leaving the pitch was reported to have attacked the referees, threatened a journalist and waved off sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli during the post match celebrations.[163]

Despite winning the Coppa Italia, two days after the final Juventus announced they had sacked Allegri, mainly due to his behaviour during the game not being in line with the club's values,[164] Juventus announced that former defender Paolo Montero would take charge for the final two league games of the season.

On 12 June 2024, Juventus announced that former Bologana coach and Inter Milan midfielder Thiago Motta would become their new head coach for the 2024–25 season, on a three-year contract.[165]

Juventus have played in black and white striped shirts, with white shorts, sometimes black shorts since 1901–02 season.[166] Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in December 1901 the club sought to replace them.[167] Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin.[167] Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.[167]

Juventus's official emblem has undergone different and small modifications since the 1920s. The previous modification of the Juventus badge took place in 2004, when the emblem of the team changed to a black-and-white oval shield of a type used by Italian ecclesiastics. It is divided in five vertical stripes: two white stripes and three black stripes, inside which are the following elements, while in its upper section the name of the society superimposed on a white convex section, over golden curvature (gold for honour). The white silhouette of a charging bull is in the lower section of the oval shield, superimposed on a black old French shield and the charging bull is a symbol of the comune of Turin. There is also a black silhouette of a mural crown above the black spherical triangle's base. This is a reminiscence to Augusta Tourinorum, the old city of the Roman era which the present capital of Piedmont region is its cultural heiress. In January 2017, president Andrea Agnelli announced the change to the Juventus badge for a logotype. More specifically, it is a pictogram composed by a stylised Black and White "J" which Agnelli said reflects "the Juventus way of living."[168] Juventus was the first team in sports history to adopt a star as a symbol associated with any competition's triumph, who added one above their badge in 1958 to represent their tenth Italian Football Championship and Serie A title, and has since become popularized with other clubs as well.[169]

In the past, the convex section of the emblem had a blue colour (another symbol of Turin) and it was concave in shape. The old French shield and the mural crown, also in the lower section of the emblem, had a considerably greater size. The two "Golden Stars for Sport Excellence" were located above the convex and concave section of Juventus's emblem. During the 1980s, the club emblem was the blurred silhouette of a zebra, alongside the two golden stars with the club's name forming an arc above.

Juventus unofficially won their 30th league title in 2011–12, but a dispute with the FIGC, which stripped Juventus of their 2004–05 title and did not assign them the 2005–06 title due to their involvement in the Calciopoli scandal, left their official total at 28; the club elected to wear no stars at all the following season, but added the message "30 sul campo" ("30 on the pitch", referring to the two titles that were won but vacated) underneath the badge.[170] Juventus won their 30th title in 2013–14 and thus earned the right to wear their third star, but Agnelli stated that the club suspended the use of the stars until another team wins their 20th championship, having the right to wear two stars "to emphasise the difference".[171] For the 2015–16 season, Juventus reintroduced the stars and added the third star to their jersey as well with new kit manufacturers Adidas, in addition to the Coppa Italia badge for winning their tenth Coppa Italia the previous season.[172] For the 2016–17 season, Juventus re-designed their kit with a different take on the trademark black and white stripes.[173] For the 2017–18 season, Juventus introduced the J shaped logo onto the kits.[174]

In September 2015, Juventus officially announced a new project called JKids for its junior supporters on its website. Along with this project, Juventus also introduced a new mascot to all its fans which is called J. J is a cartoon-designed zebra, black and white stripes with golden edge piping on its body, golden shining eyes, and three golden stars on the front of its neck.[175] J made its debut at Juventus Stadium on 12 September 2015.[176]

During its history, the club has acquired a number of nicknames, la Vecchia Signora (the Old Lady) being the best example. The "old" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means "youth" in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The "lady" part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed la Fidanzata d'Italia (lit. 'the Girlfriend of Italy'), because over the years it has received a high level of support from Southern Italian immigrant workers (particularly from Naples and Palermo), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include [la] Madama (Piedmontese for Madam), i bianconeri (lit. 'the black-and-whites'), le zebre (lit. 'the zebras')[j] in reference to Juventus's colours. I gobbi (lit. 'the hunchbacks') is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for team's players. The most widely accepted origin of gobbi dates to the fifties, when the bianconeri wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.[177]

The official anthem of Juventus is Juve (storia di un grande amore), or Juve (story of a great love) in English, written by Alessandra Torre and Claudio Guidetti, in the version of the singer and musician Paolo Belli composed in 2007.[178] In 2016, a documentary film called Black and White Stripes: The Juventus Story was produced by the La Villa brothers about Juventus.[179] On 16 February 2018, the first three episodes of a docu-series called First Team: Juventus, which followed the club throughout the season, by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on Netflix; the other three episodes were released on 6 July 2018.[180] On 25 November 2021, an eight-episode docu-series called All or Nothing: Juventus, which followed the club throughout the season, by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on Amazon Prime.[181]

After the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza d'Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905 (the first year of the scudetto) and in 1906, years in which they played at the Corso Re Umberto.

From 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp before moving the following year to Corso Marsiglia Camp, where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles. At the end of 1933, they began to play at the new Stadio Benito Mussolini inaugurated for the 1934 World Championships. After the Second World War, the stadium was renamed as Stadio Comunale Vittorio Pozzo. Juventus played home matches at the ground for 57 years, a total of 890 league matches.[183] The team continued to host training sessions at the stadium until July 2003.[184]

From 1990 until the 2005–06 season, the Torinese side contested their home matches at Stadio delle Alpi, built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, although in very rare circumstances the club played some home games in other stadia such as Renzo Barbera at Palermo, Dino Manuzzi in Cesena and the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in Milan.[184]

In August 2006, Juventus returned to play in the Stadio Comunale, then known as Stadio Olimpico, after the restructuring of the stadium for the 2006 Winter Olympics onward. In November 2008, Juventus announced that they would invest around €120 million to build a new ground, the Juventus Stadium, on the site of delle Alpi.[185] Unlike the old ground, there is not a running track and instead the pitch is only 7.5 metres away from the stands.[4] The capacity is 41,507.[4] Work began during spring 2009 and the stadium was opened on 8 September 2011, ahead of the start of the 2011–12 season.[186] Since 1 July 2017, the Juventus Stadium is known commercially as the Allianz Stadium of Turin until 30 June 2030.[187][188]
Supporters
See also: Juventus F.C. ultras

Juventus is the most-supported football club in Italy, with over 12 million fans or tifosi, which represent approximately 34% of the total Italian football fans according to a research published in September 2016 by Italian research agency Demos & Pi,[22] as well as one of the most supported football clubs in the world, with over 300 million supporters (41 million in Europe alone),[23] particularly in the Mediterranean countries to which a large number of Italian diaspora have emigrated.[189] The Torinese side has fan clubs branches across the globe.[190]

Demand for Juventus tickets in occasional home games held away from Turin is high, suggesting that Juventus have stronger support in other parts of the country. Juventus is widely and especially popular throughout mainland Southern Italy, Sicily and Malta, leading the team to have one of the largest followings in its away matches,[191] more than in Turin itself.
Club rivalries

Scene from the Derby d'Italia in 1930

Juventus have significant rivalries with two main clubs.

Their traditional rivals are fellow Turin club Torino; matches between the two sides are known as the Derby della Mole (Turin Derby). The rivalry dates back to 1906 as Torino was founded by break-away Juventus players and staff.

Their most high-profile rivalry is with Inter Milan, another big Serie A club located in Milan, the capital of the neighbouring region of Lombardy. Matches between these two clubs are referred to as the Derby d'Italia (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other at the top of the league table, hence the intense rivalry.[192] Until the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably, the two sides are the first and the second most supported clubs in Italy and the rivalry has intensified since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-Calciopoli, with the return of Juventus to Serie A.[192][193]

The rivalry with AC Milan is a rivalry between the two most titled and two of the most supported teams in Italy.[194] The match-ups between Milan and Juventus, is regarded as the championship of Serie A, and both teams were often fighting for the top positions of the standings, sometimes even decisive for the award of the title.[195]

They also have rivalries with Roma,[196] Fiorentina[197] and Napoli.[198]
Youth programme
Main article: Juventus F.C. Youth Sector

The Juventus youth set-up has been recognised as one of the best in Italy for producing young talents.[199] While not all graduates made it to the first team, many have enjoyed successful careers in the Italian top flight. Under long-time coach Vincenzo Chiarenza, the Primavera (under-19) squad enjoyed one of its successful periods, winning all age-group competitions from 2004 to 2006. Like Dutch club Ajax and many Premier League clubs, Juventus operates several satellite clubs and football schools outside of the country (i.e. United States, Canada, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Switzerland) and numerous camps in the local region to expand talent scouting.[200] On 3 August 2018, Juventus founded their professional reserve team, called Juventus U23 (renamed to Juventus Next Gen in August 2022),[201] playing in Serie C,[202] who won the Coppa Italia Serie C in 2020.[203] In the 2021–22 UEFA Youth League, the U19 squad reached the semi-finals, equalling the best-ever placing in the competition for a Serie A team.[204]

The youth system is also notable for its contribution to the Italian national senior and youth teams. 1934 World Cup winner Gianpiero Combi, 1936 Gold Medal and 1938 World Cup winner Pietro Rava, Giampiero Boniperti, Roberto Bettega, 1982 World Cup hero Paolo Rossi and more recently Claudio Marchisio and Sebastian Giovinco are a number of former graduates who have gone on to make the first team and full Italy squad.[205]

Chairmen history
See also: List of Juventus F.C. chairmen

Juventus have had overall 24 presidents (Italian: presidenti, lit. 'presidents' or Italian: presidenti del consiglio di amministrazione, lit. 'chairmen of the board of directors') and two administrative committees, some of which have been members of the club's main stakeholder group and elected since the club's foundation by the then assemblea di soci (membership assembly) through an annual meeting. Since 1949, they have been often corporate managers that were nominated in charge by the assemblea degli azionisti (stakeholders assembly). On top of chairmen, there were several living former presidents, that were nominated as the honorary chairmen (Italian: Presidenti Onorari, lit. 'honorary presidents').[207]

Italy's most successful club of the 20th century[21] and the most winning in the history of Italian football,[209] Juventus have won the Italian League Championship, the country's premier football club competitions and organised by Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie A (LNPA), a record 36 times and have the records of consecutive triumphs in that tournament (nine, between 2011–12 and 2019–20).[40][210] They have also won the Coppa Italia, the country's primary single-elimination competitions, a record 15 times, becoming the first team to retain the trophy successfully with their triumph in the 1959–60 season, and the first to win it in three consecutive seasons from the 2014–15 season to the 2016–17 season, going on to win a fourth consecutive title in 2017–18 (also a record).[211] In addition, the club holds the record for Supercoppa Italiana wins with nine, the most recent coming in 2020.

Overall, Juventus have won 71 official competitions,[p] more than any other club in the country: 60 at national level (which is also a record) and 11 at international stage,[212] making them, in the latter case, the second most successful Italian team.[213] The club is sixth in Europe and twelfth in the world with the most international title won officially recognised by their respective association football confederation and Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA).[q] In 1977, the Torinese side become the first in Southern Europe to have won the UEFA Cup and the first—and only to date—in Italian football history to achieve an international title with a squad composed by national footballers.[215] In 1993, the club won its third competition's trophy, an unprecedented feat in the continent until then, a confederation record for the next 22 years and the most for an Italian team. Juventus was also the first club in the country to achieve the title in the European Super Cup, having won the competitions in 1984 and the first European side to win the Intercontinental Cup in 1985, since it was restructured by Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol (CONMEBOL)'s organizing committee five years beforehand.[18]

The club has earned the distinction of being allowed to wear three golden stars (Italian: stelle d'oro) on its shirts representing its league victories, the tenth of which was achieved during the 1957–58 season, the 20th in the 1981–82 season and the 30th in the 2013–14 season. Juventus were the first Italian team to have achieved the national double four times (winning the Italian top tier division and the national cup competitions in the same season), in the 1959–60, 1994–95, 2014–15 and 2015–16 season. In the 2015–16 season, Juventus won the Coppa Italia for the 11th time and their second-straight title, becoming the first team in Italy's history to complete Serie A and Coppa Italia doubles in back-to-back season; Juventus would go on to win another two consecutive doubles in 2016–17 and 2017–18.[110]

Founded as an association, in 1923, during the Edoardo Agnelli presidency, the club, at the time ruled by an assemblea di soci (membership assembly), became one of the first in the country to acquire professional status ante litteram, starting also the longest and most uninterrupted society in Italian sports history between a club and a private investor. Juventus was restructured as the football section of multisports parent company Juventus – Organizzazione Sportiva S.A. since the constitution of the later in that year to 1943, when it was merged with another three Torinese enterprises for founding the Compagnia Industriale Sportiva Italia (CISITALIA). In that twenty years Juventus progressive competed in different disciplines such as tennis, swimming, ice hockey, and bocce, gaining success in the first cited. After a long liquidation process of the automotive corporation started after the Italian Civil War (1945), all Juventus O.S.A. sections were closed with the exception of football and tennis, which were demerged. The football section, then called Juventus Cisitalia for sponsorship reasons, was renamed Juventus Football Club and the Agnelli family, which some members have held different executive charges inside the club for the past six years,[12] obtained the club's majority shares after industrialist Piero Dusio, Cisitalia owner, transferred his capital shares in the ending of the decade.[243] Juventus has been constituted as an independent società a responsabilità limitata (S.r.l.), a type of private limited company, in August 1949 and supervised by a consiglio d'amministrazione (board of directors) since then.[244]

On 27 June 1967, the Torinese club changed its legal corporate status to società per azioni (S.p.A.)[245] and on 3 December 2001 it became the third in the country to has been listed on the Borsa Italiana after Lazio and Roma;[246] since that date until 19 September 2011, Juventus's stock took part of the Segmento Titoli con Alti Requisiti (STAR), one of the main market segment in the world.[247] Since October 2016 to December 2018,[248] and again since March 2020,[249] The club's stock is iscrited in the FTSE Italia Mid Cap stock market index of the Mercato Telematico Azionario (MTA); previously, between December 2018 and March 2020, it was listed in the FTSE MIB index.[250] The club has also a secondary listing on Borsa's sister stock exchange based in London.

As of 29 October 2021, Juventus's shares are distributed between 63.8% to the Agnelli family through EXOR N.V., a holding part of the Giovanni Agnelli and C.S.a.p.a Group, 11.9% to Lindsell Train Investment Trust Ltd. and 24.3% distributed to other stakeholders (<3% each)[251][252] though the Associazione Piccoli Azionisti della Juventus Football Club, created in 2010 and composed by more 40,000 affiliated,[253] including investors as the Royal Bank of Scotland, the Norway Government Pension Fund Global, one sovereign wealth fund,[254] the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) and the investment management corporation BlackRock.[255]

From 1 July 2008, the club has implemented a safety management system for employees and athletes in compliance with the requirements of international OHSAS 18001:2007 regulation[256] and a Safety Management System in the medical sector according to the international ISO 9001:2000 resolution.[257]

The club is one of the founding members of the European Club Association (ECA), which was formed after the merge of the G-14, an independent group of selected European clubs with international TV rights purposes, with the European Clubs Forum (ECF), a clubs' task force ruled by UEFA composed by 102 members,[258] which Juventus was a founder and permanent member by sporting merits, respectively.[259]

Juventus was placed seventh in the global ranking drawn up by the British consultancy organisation Brand Finance in terms of brand power, where it was rated with a credit rating AAA ("extremely strong") with a score of 86.1 out of 100,[260] as well as eleventh in terms of brand value (€705 million)[261] and ninth by enterprise value (€2294 billion as of 24 May 2022).[262] All this made I Bianconeri, in 2015, the country's second sports club—first in football—after Scuderia Ferrari by brand equity.[263]

It is ranked in the 11th place on Forbes' list of the most valuable football clubs at international level with an estimate value of US$2.05 billion (as of May 2024).

in May 2016, it became the first football club in the country to cross the billion euro mark.[264]

According to the Deloitte Football Money League, a research published by consultants Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in March 2022, Juventus is the ninth-highest earning football club in the world with an estimated revenue of €433.5 million as of 30 June 2021[265] and, on 2002, the club reached the second position overall, the highest-ever achieved for a Serie A team, a ranking which they retained for the following two years.[266]

Multisport activities

The club was involved in various sports activities at different times until the late 1970s. Initially, from its foundation until 1899, it had sections for cycling, athletics, wrestling, and running.

In the early 1920s, Juventus expanded its sports involvement, led by President Edoardo Agnelli. This led to the creation of Juventus Organizzazione Sportiva Anonima, which participated in various national championships in disciplines such as bowls, swimming, ice hockey, and tennis until its dissolution after World War II, with tennis being the most successful. Juventus achieved its greatest successes with the tennis section.[272] In the late 1960s, a skiing section named Sporting Club Juventus was established, based in Castagneto Po and active throughout the following decade.[273][274]

In the 2017–2018 season, Juventus established a women's football section with a team in the Serie A women's championship.[275][276] The Women's team won the league in their debut season, mirroring the achievement of the men's team and becoming the first Italian club to hold both major national football championships, male and female, simultaneously.[277] This success continued for the next two seasons.[278][279]

Since 2019, the club has had an eSports section.[280][281] In 2021, the team won the eFootball.Pro, a prominent eSports competition for club teams worldwide.[282] In the same year, they also claimed the TIMVISION Cup | eSports Edition, the first digital edition of the Italian Cup organized by the Lega Serie A.[283] In 2023, under the name Juventus Dsyre – in collaboration with the eSports team of the same name[284] – they secured their first Italian championship title in the eSerie A TIM, the virtual version of Serie A organized by the Lega Serie A.[285]

Notes

The literal translation of bianconeri is "whiteblacks". However, "black and whites" is also commonly used.
The founding date of Juventus is unknown; conventionally, 1 November 1897 is used.[1][2]
Called "Sporting tradition" (Italian: Tradizione sportiva), it is the historical ranking made by Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) based on the weighted score of the official titles won by the clubs in the seasonal competitions since 1898 and the overall seasons in which it has participated in the first three professional levels since the creation of the round-robin tournament (1929). The governing body of Italian football often uses it in promotion and relegation and broadcast cases.[8]
As of June 2020, Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), based in its own coefficient's standard calculation procedure, applies two points for each match won and one point for each point drawn in European Champions' Cup and Champions League, UEFA Cup and Europa League, UEFA Super Cup, Cup Winners' Cup, UEFA Intertoto Cup and Intercontinental Cup for historical-statistical purposes; not considering the introduction of three points for a match won at international level in 1994–95 season.[10]
During the Italian resistance against Nazi-fascism (1943–1945), the club, at the time a multisports association, was controlled by Torinese industrialist and former Juventus player Piero Dusio through car house Cisitalia; however, various members of the Agnelli family have held various positions at executive level in the club since 1939.[12]
Excluding competitions organised by a private committee not related with a governing body such as the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup or the Mitropa Cup.
Frédéric Dick, a son of Alfred Dick, was a Swiss footballer and joined the team of the Juventus that won the tournament of the Second Category in 1905.
The other club was Barcelona with its captain, the Argentinian star Lionel Messi. Messi was awarded Ballon d'Or for four years in a row from 2009 to 2013.[44]
Without considering the penalty, Juventus would have qualified to the Champions League with 72 points.
The zebra is Juventus's official mascot because the black and white vertical stripes in its present home jersey and emblem remembered the zebra's stripes.

"The suspicion, in short, is that the path of summary justice was chosen, to eliminate from the scene characters like Moggi, ultimately expelled from Juve and then condemned by sports justice based on wiretapping which, are the words of the sentences, did not prove none of the allegations. Based on the first interceptions ordered by the Turin's public prosecutor and prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello, who had ordered the dismissal of the investigation opened for alleged sports fraud already in July 2005 on the grounds that, for the crime in question, 'are not allowed.' The prosecutor had underlined the 'weakness of the accusatory hypothesis.' Yet, according to the authors, the investigation that led to the commissioner of the FIGC, the landing in via Allegri of Guido Rossi, and the new head of the investigation office, Francesco Saverio Borrelli, started from that weak accusatory hypothesis, to the involvement of referees and designators, of six first and second row clubs (in addition to Juve, Milan, Fiorentina, Lazio, Reggina and Arezzo) and, finally, to the real sentence for a few. Indeed, only for Moggi and Juve, kicked out and relegated to B."

"Justice decided that Moggi and Giraudo actually 'polluted' the system, it decided so in 2006 and did not want to know or understand other truths. Indeed, it had already decided it during the investigations, when all the phone calls that could exonerate or alleviate the position of Juventus's executives had not been taken into consideration, to the point of dismantling the very concept of the Cupola. Moggi and Giraudo, therefore, 'polluted' the system: a term that serves to dodge the fact that no judge has ever returned enough evidence to affirm that championship (the subject of investigation was only 2004–05) has actually been altered. Indeed, in the first instance sentence we basically read the opposite."

"Juventus has been acquitted, the offending championships (2004/2005 and 2005/2006) have been declared regular, and the reasons for the conviction of Luciano Moggi are vague; mostly, they condemn his position, that he was in a position to commit a crime. In short, be careful to enter a shop without surveillance because even if you don't steal, you would have had the opportunity. And go on to explain to your friends that you're honest people after the morbid and pro-sales campaign of the newspapers. ... a club has been acquitted, and no one has heard of it, and whoever has heard of it, they don't accept it. The verdict of 2006, made in a hurry, was acceptable, that of Naples was not. The problem then lies not so much in vulgar journalism as in readers who accept the truths that are convenient. Juventus was, rightly or wrongly, the best justification for the failures of others, and it was in popular sentiment, as evidenced by the new controversies concerning 'The System.' But how? Wasn't the rotten erased? The referees since 2006 make mistakes in good faith, the word of Massimo Moratti (the only 'honest'). ... it isn't a question of tifo, but of a critical spirit, of the desire to deepen and not be satisfied with the headlines (as did Oliviero Beha, a well-known Viola [Fiorentina] fan, who, however, drew conclusions outside the chorus because, despite enjoying it as a tifoso, he suffered as a journalist. He wasn't satisfied and went into depth. He was one of the few)."

"The Juventus defence, among other things, objects that a sum of several Articles 1 (unfair and dishonest sporting conduct) cannot lead to an indictment for Article 6 (sporting offence), using for example the metaphor that so many defamations do not carry a murder conviction: an unimpeachable objection. ... Hence the grotesque concept of 'standings altered without any match-fixing'. The 'Calciopoli' rulings state that there is no match-fixing. That the championship under investigation, 2004–2005, is to be considered regular. But that the Juventus management has achieved effective standings advantages for Juventus FC even without altering the individual matches. In practice, Juventus was convicted of murder, with no one dead, no evidence, no accomplices, no murder weapon. Only for the presence of a hypothetical motive."

"FIGC's actions in relegating Juventus and handing the title to Inter Milan were somewhat peculiar. Of course, Moggi and Juventus deserved punishment; that is not up for dispute. However, the severity of the ruling and the new location for the Scudetto was unprecedented and arguably should never have happened. The final ruling in the Calciopoli years later judged that Juventus had never breached article 6. As a result, the Serie A champions should never have encountered a shock 1–1 draw away to Rimini in the season's curtain-raiser. Nor should they have trounced Piacenza 4–0 in Turin or handed a 5–1 thrashing away to Arezzo in Tuscany. The findings stated that some club officials had violated article 6, but none had originated from Juventus. FIGC created a structured article violation with their decision-making. This means that instead of finding an article 6 breach, several article 1 violations were pieced together to create evidence damning to warrant relegation from Italy's top flight. Article 1 violations in Italian football usually command fines, bans, or points deductions, but certainly not relegation."

Finally point 1), the so-called positive part of the motivations, that is, in fact everything is regular. And then the scandal of 'Scommettopoli' [the Italian football scandal of 2011] in which it's coming out that the 2010–2011 championship [won by Milan] as a whole with tricks is to be considered really and decidedly irregular? The Chief Prosecutor of Cremona, Di Martino, says so for now, while sports justice takes its time as always, but I fear that many will soon repeat it, unless everything is silenced. With all due respect to those who want the truth and think that Moggi has objectively become the 'scapegoat'. Does the framework of information that does not investigate, analyze, compare, and take sides out of ignorance or bias seem slightly clearer to you?"
